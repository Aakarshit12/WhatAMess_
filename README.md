# WhatAMess

WhatAMess is a hyperlocal mess discovery and meal ordering platform. The goal of the project is to help students and working professionals easily find nearby mess services, explore menus, and streamline subscriptions or daily meal orders.

## 🚀 Vision

Finding reliable food options around colleges and workplaces is often messy: scattered information, no standard pricing, and limited discovery. WhatAMess centralizes this into a single digital platform with search, comparison, and ordering capabilities.
